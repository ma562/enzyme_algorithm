function v_0 = M4_Algorithm_calcv0_004_09(data, column)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% ENGR 132 
% Program Description 
% The following function takes in data and the column of interest to
% calculate v0. It takes the slope at the initial 2.5% of the data and
% returns that as v0.
%
% Function Call
% M4_Algorithm_calcv0_004_09(data, column)
%
% Input Arguments
% data- data collected from the csv
% column- column of interest in the csv 
%
% Output Arguments
% v_0- the calculated v0 values based on the initial slope of the curve (Î¼M/s)
